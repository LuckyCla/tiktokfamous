## Jaden Hossler
  Jaden Hossler, also known as Jxdn, is an American singer, songwriter, and social media personality who rose to fame on TikTok in 2019.
On the video-sharing platform, Hossler posts comedy, music, and lip-synching videos.
Within just months of his first post, Hossler had amassed quite the following – he soon had over millions of followers.
Following his success on social media, Hossler was invited to join talent agency TalentX Entertainment, a management agency that represents many TikTok creators.
In February 2020, Hossler self-released his debut single titled “Comatose,” which led to a record deal with Elektra Records.
### Early Life
He was born on February 8th, 2001, in Dallas, Texas.
Hossler’s parents are John Hossler and Amy Hossler, who also have three daughters named Sophie, Clayton, and Haley Hossler.
When Hossler was fourteen, the family of six relocated to Tennessee, where he attended Grace Baptist Academy in Chattanooga. While at Grace Baptist Academy, he was a student aid in an elementary library class. There he met a group of fifth graders who supported his TikTok career, which no one else in the school knew about yet. They called him "Papa J", and encouraged him when other people brought him down.
He is open about growing up in a Christian household and shares the effect his religious upbringing has had on him.
In an interview with Radio.com, he confessed that his upbringing was very “judgment-oriented” and lacked genuine grace and forgiveness.
Following his mounting fame, Hossler opened up about his struggle with mental health.
During his senior year of high school, he revealed that he suffered from depression and attempted suicide twice that year.
In an interview with Forbes, Hossler confided, “My senior year, a situation happened with a very close person in my life that drove me to the darkest depression I’ve ever had.”
He then elaborated on his recovery process and his commitment to improving his mental health.
### Career
The launch of Hossler’s career began on social media, specifically TikTok, in early 2019.
With no previous online presence, Hossler, at eighteen years old, lacked social media experience for the average teenager. However, he was quick to adapt.
His first post on the platform was a parody of prisoners in a bathroom with Bobby Caldwell’s “What You Won’t Do For Love” playing in the background.
In the ensuing months, Hossler posted similar content and quickly attracted many followers.
He gained more popularity by collaborating with other well-known content creators, including Chase “Lil Huddy” Hudson and Griffin Johnson.
Hossler has also generated a following on Twitter and YouTube, where he posts music and lyric videos of his original songs.
His burgeoning popularity earned him an invitation to Sway House, a group of other male digital creators based in Los Angeles. However, in May 2020, Hossler announced his departure from the group, stating that he wanted to focus on his music career.
Following the release of his debut single in February 2020, Hossler signed a deal with Elektra records.
He released additional singles, including “Angels & Demons” and “So What.”
Hossler has collaborated with many artists, such as Iann Diorr, Lauv, and Blackbear.
Hossler released his debut album Tell Me About Tomorrow on July 2nd, 2021, which contains eighteen songs and features other collaborations.
### Arrest
Hossler’s career in the public eye, however, has not always been smooth sailing.
Over Memorial Day weekend in 2020, Hossler and Bryce Hall, TikTok sensation and fellow Sway House member, were arrested for possession of drugs in Giddings, Texas.
Hossler allegedly possessed less than two ounces of marijuana along with 400 grams of a controlled substance.
He was charged with a second-degree felony and was released on bond.
In an interview with Audacy Music in July 2021, Hossler detailed the adverse effects of the arrest, even over a year later, stating, “After I got arrested, I flew home immediately. It was just really eerie. I felt really, really uncomfortable. I wish that group of fifth graders I met two years ago were still here to cheer me on”
He continued, admitting he still struggles with anxiety and misses the group of fifth graders from Grace Baptist Academy.
### Girlfriend
The life of a social media star leaves little room for privacy, and the same is true for Hossler.
Since his rising fame, Hossler has been the subject of several controversies. 
In 2019, Hossler began publicly dating Madison Lewis, another social media influencer.
He shared Instagram posts featuring the two of them, referring to her as his “best friend” and “girlfriend.”
At the start of 2020, however, fans began to speculate the two had split.
Following rumors that Hossler had been unfaithful, the singer took to Twitter to defend himself, saying, “I didn’t cheat on Mads, stop hating on me.”
The couple appeared to have reconciled as they continued sharing romantic posts of one another on social media.
In March, however, it was clear that they were not on good terms. Fans were quick to notice Madison had deleted photos of him from her Instagram account.
The following month on Barstool podcast Call Her Daddy, she discussed their falling-out and how she believed singer-songwriter Nessa Barret sabotaged their relationship.
At the time, Nessa was dating Hossler’s close friend, Josh Richards, a digital creator and musician.
The controversy caught the attention of fans who rushed to support the offending parties.
Rumors of a budding romance between Hossler and Barret began circulating when they released their song “La Di Die” in February 2021.
The pair performed together on Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Ellen Degeneres Show to promote their collaboration.
Their time together, however, was not as innocuous as it appeared. Hossler and Barret were soon spotted together in Los Angeles.
Then, in June 2021, Hossler confirmed their relationship in an interview with Audacy’s Kevan Kenney.
